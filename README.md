# The_Gait_recognition_model

Now some important information about project 
This project also consist of real time authentication using webcam and also input video matching with dataset.
the project name is 'Human Authentication Using Gait Recognition' as the name of the project the model identify the human on the basis of walking pattern of the human. Firstly in dataset you want to add folder with sample person name then inside that folder add the walking video of that person. then run the build_dataset file it will create the dataset of the all videos and save in csv file then run the train model it will train model extract all feature of the persons walking pattern.Then inside of the test_recoganize give path of unknown input video then run the test_recognize file it will compare with dataset and will give the output name and accuracy. 

***There are two main model recognising file are missing. This two file must require to run the model. If you want this file you can just contact me on LinkedIn. The contact link is on my profile.

seconnd folder of Gait_Authentication_Gui which supports gui this is fully functional gait model with accuracy 85% to 95% if there is any kind of error or how to run? problem then contact me on LinkdIn.
